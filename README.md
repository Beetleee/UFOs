# Module 11: UFOs and Javascript

### by Terra Lasho

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
I am tasked to provide filters for an HTML page which is being generated which will allow the user to select for specific information, pulled from a javascript data file.  This project will facilitate the user to be able to extract specific sighting data on timeframe, location, and shape of sighting from reports on UFOs from a master database.  The plan is to link a plan (app.js) to a database (data.js) with html (index.html) and css (style.css).
## Results
### Interactive HTML Page

#### Deliverable 1a: The list element that creates the button is removed, and there are five list elements for filtering in the index.html file.

#### Deliverable 1b: The event listener is modified to detect changes to each filter in the app.js file. (10 pt)

#### Deliverable 1c: The updateFilters() function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed. (20 pt)

#### Deliverable 1d: The filterTable() function loops through all of the filters and keeps any data that matches the filter values. (20 pt)

#### Deliverable 1e: The webpage filters the table correctly based on user input. (20 pt)
#### This is a search for sightings on 1/1/2010 in El Cajon, CA, US for triangle shaped sightings…. The user only has to click the directive search boxes to find what he/she wishes…

## SUMMARY:
Overall, this analysis resulted in the creation of a clean webpage, which allows a user to perform search criteria to filter through a database using search options I created.  A drawback of this database is the prior knowledge of what search criteria are actually listed in the database -as the user has to “try” different dates/cities, before the results come in.  I would like to see a dropdown menu or combo type search box that lists the options which the user can choose when performing searches.  Also, incorporating more data into this database would be very helpful.  This project was a great way to use interfacing applications to read, extract, transfer, and incorporate information via coding.
